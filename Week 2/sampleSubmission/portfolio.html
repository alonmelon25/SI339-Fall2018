UX Portfolio: My Latest Work

Impact in Information
    IMPACT in InformAtion: Interaction Design
    Fall 2018

    Project
        Semester-long project in which I designed a web-based product designed to connect UMSI students interested in impact-related work (social impact, environmental impact, accessibility, universal design, etc) with jobs/internships, people, projects, and events near Southeast Michigan.

    Impact/Outcomes
        After two days of intensive work, our team created a presentation of recommended programming for three library branch locations. It is our hope that the DPLF will be able to take these recommendations and repeat our research and iteration process to develop programming for the remaining library branches. Our research included understanding the geographical area and the population it included to create recommendations that were based in the population’s needs and preferences. The PODs will have incredible implications for access to needed services like Wifi, access to technology, and learning valuable skills through programming in the immediate Detroit area.

POD Programming

    POD Programming: Detroit Public Library Foundation
        Fall 2018
        UMSI Alternative Fall Break

    Project
        A team of students traveled to Detroit for a two day design-jam-like session in which we worked with the Detroit Public Library Foundation to help them design programming for their satellite library locations, which were in the works for community outreach. These locations would exist within recycled shipping containers turned into small buildings known as "pods." Groups within our team split up to develop programming specific to the geographical area in which these pods would be placed. The programming we developed were relevant to the populations and business needs of the community in which they would be placed. Our final deliverable was a presentation on recommended programming as well as several design ideas for specific classes.

Ferndale Parks and Recreation
    
    Contextual Inquiry: Ferndale Parks & Recreation
        Fall 2018

    Project
        A semester-long project where a team of students and me partnered with the Ferndale Parks and Recreation to address their needs in communication and outreach strategies within the community. We utilized a specialized interview technique aimed at understanding root causes and the context in which a problem is placed in order to develop recommended next steps. Throughout the semester my team has developed an interview protocol, conducted key-informant interviews, developed and synthesized an affinity wall (a qualitative data analysis method), and are currently working on our recommendations from our findings.  It is our hope that the organization will take these recommendations and implement them. These recommendations considered varying factors such as cost, feasibility, effectiveness, and time to implement.

    Impact / Outcomes
        Improvement of Ferndale Parks and Recreation communication strategies both internally as well as with the Ferndale community. Our final product consisted of a consulting report with recommendations for strategies the organization could use to improve its communication. We included findings from our interviews in this report, which outlined the issues identified by the interviewees as well as the root cause of many of the organization's problems.

Alumni Donations Project
    Alumni donations: A course Design Thinking project
        Fall 2017

    Project
        A semester-long project where my team of fellow students ideated, prototyped, and user tested a concept for addressing a lack of alumni donations to the University of Michigan especially from students who had recently graduated. Together, my team brainstormed, conducted user interviews, created sketches and a conceptual prototype, created personas and story maps, and pitched a potential solution including a new, user-friendly website for donations (redesigning the current site).

    Impact / Outcomes
        The intended impact of developing a solution for the University’s Alumni donations strategies was to increase lifelong donations and alumni connections to the University. When alumni give early on, they are more likely to donate in the future, and the hope is to build that connection and long term relationship between alum and school.
