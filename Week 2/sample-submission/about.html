Hi, i'm Chris Green.
User Experience & Social Impact Designer



Chris Green
â€‹An Aspiring User Experience and Social Impact Designer

-- and a lover of all things cinema.

Human behavior was my passion from the very beginning when I decided to major in Psychology (my undergraduate degree). I took a class in Web Design that piqued my interest in design that was long-since dormant (since high school in 2010-2012 when I learned Photoshop in Graphic Design courses). Wanting to help people was always my number-one goal.
 
Fast forward into my Social Work degree, I concentrated in Management, which led me to the Social Entrepreneurship space where design, iteration, and prototyping are immersed within trying to solve social problems. I took a course called "Social Entrepreneurship" that was a bootcamp for coming up with impactful ideas using Design Thinking; then my course in Creating and Design for Entrepreneurship drew that process (Design Thinking) out in a semester-long project and I was hooked from there.

User-Centered Design for Social Impact is my passion.

In my free time, you'll find me relaxing with my dog, Deja, and watching movies about supernatural things and sitcoms. I love to alternate between lattes, tea, and apple cider.
 
You'll often find me engaged in community engagement projects at the School of Social Work at U-M or at the School of Information, trying to bridge technology with Change.
